3. **Dashboard**: Clicks “New Draft” to open Editor.  
4. **Editor**: Writes/pastes copy; inline grammar/tone suggestions appear.  
5. **Subject-Line Optimizer**: Opens modal, selects variant (e.g., 38% open rate).  
6. **SEO Tab**: Addresses issues (e.g., “Add H2”).  
7. **Export**: Downloads HTML email, pastes into HubSpot.  
8. **Dashboard Return**: Sees updated optimization score and streak.
