## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never trust user input**
   - Always validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Use the validation utilities in `/lib/security/`

2. **Use parameterized queries**
   - Supabase client handles this automatically
   - Never concatenate user input into queries

3. **Implement least privilege**
   - Users can only access their own data
   - Admin features require explicit role checks

4. **Handle errors securely**
   - Never expose stack traces or system details
   - Use generic error messages for users
   - Log detailed errors server-side only

5. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regular `npm audit` checks
   - Update dependencies promptly
   - Review security advisories

### For Users

1. **Strong authentication**
   - Use magic links or OAuth providers
   - No password management required

2. **Data privacy**
   - Export your data anytime
   - Delete your account and all data
   - View your activity history

3. **Secure communication**
   - All traffic encrypted with HTTPS
   - Secure WebSocket connections
   - No data transmitted in URLs
