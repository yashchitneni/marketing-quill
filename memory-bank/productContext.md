# MarketingQuill Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
SaaS marketing managers face several pain points when creating email campaigns and blog content:
- **Time-consuming optimization**: Manual grammar checking, tone adjustments, and SEO optimization
- **Inconsistent quality**: Varying writing quality across campaigns without systematic feedback
- **Fragmented workflow**: Switching between multiple tools for writing, checking, and optimizing
- **Subject line uncertainty**: Difficulty predicting email open rates without A/B testing infrastructure
- **Export complexity**: Manual formatting for different platforms (email clients, CMS, etc.)

### Market Opportunity
Marketing managers need a unified tool that combines writing, AI-powered suggestions, and optimization in a single, focused interface. Current solutions are either too complex (enterprise suites) or too basic (simple grammar checkers).

## How It Should Work

1. **Quick Start**: Visit marketingquill.app → "Start Free Trial" → Sign up via email/Google
2. **Onboarding**: Optional brand voice setup → Land on Dashboard
3. **Content Creation**: "New Draft" → Write in distraction-free editor
4. **AI Enhancement**: Real-time inline suggestions appear as user types
5. **Optimization**: Use Subject-Line Optimizer for email campaigns
6. **SEO Refinement**: Address SEO recommendations in dedicated panel
7. **Export**: One-click export to HTML email or Markdown
8. **Progress Tracking**: Return to Dashboard to see optimization scores and streaks
