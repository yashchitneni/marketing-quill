# MarketingQuill Active Context

**Last Updated**: Project Initialization  
**Current Phase**: Memory Bank Setup & Project Planning

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Priority
Setting up the foundational Memory Bank system to ensure consistent project understanding across development sessions. This includes documenting all project requirements, technical decisions, and development patterns.

### Next Steps (Development Roadmap)
Based on the 7-day sprint timeline:

**Day 1**: Repo setup, authentication, landing page
- Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
- Set up Supabase integration and authentication
- Create landing page with hero section and sign-up form
- Configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components

**Day 2**: Dashboard and New Draft flow
- Build dashboard with draft cards layout
- Implement "New Draft" creation flow
- Set up basic navigation structure
- Create draft management functionality

**Day 3**: Editor core, auto-save, undo stack
- Build three-pane editor interface
- Implement auto-save mechanism (30-second intervals)
- Create undo/redo functionality with 50-action stack
- Set up basic text editing capabilities

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Created comprehensive documentation system
- **Project Analysis**: Reviewed all existing documentation (PRD, tech stack, app flow, frontend guidelines)
- **Architecture Planning**: Defined system patterns and technical approach

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Three-pane Layout**: Left sidebar (navigation) | Content area (editor) | Right sidebar (suggestions)
- **Color Scheme**: Indigo primary (#6366F1), neutral backgrounds, semantic colors for suggestions
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono for editor, Inter for UI elements
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation and high-contrast mode

### Technical Decisions
- **State Management**: Zustand for simplicity and TypeScript compatibility
- **AI Integration**: GPT-4o via Supabase Edge Functions with caching strategy
- **Real-time Features**: Supabase Realtime for live collaboration (future)
- **Performance Strategy**: <2s suggestion latency, debounced input processing

### Architecture Considerations
- **Suggestion Pipeline**: Input → Debounce (500ms) → AI Analysis → UI Update
- **Caching Strategy**: PostgreSQL caching for AI suggestions to manage costs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services unavailable
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Development Patterns
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design with feature-based organization
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage throughout
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, optimized bundle size
- **Testing**: Focus on critical user paths and AI integration points

### User Experience Patterns
- **Distraction-free Writing**: Clean, monospace editor without visual clutter
- **Non-intrusive Suggestions**: Colored underlines with hover tooltips
- **Quick Actions**: Single-click accept/reject for suggestions
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of improvement and optimization scores

### AI Integration Patterns
- **Real-time Feedback**: Suggestions appear as user types (debounced)
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain writing context for relevant suggestions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track latency and suggestion acceptance rates
- **Cost Management**: Intelligent caching and rate limiting

## Project Insights & Learnings

### Key Success Factors
1. **Performance First**: Sub-2-second latency is non-negotiable for user experience
2. **Simplicity**: Focus on core features rather than feature bloat
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance ensures broader user adoption
4. **AI Quality**: 70% suggestion acceptance rate indicates real value delivery

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **LLM Cost Control**: Aggressive caching and usage monitoring
- **Performance Reliability**: Pre-warm Edge Functions, streaming responses
- **User Adoption**: Focus on intuitive UX and immediate value delivery
- **Technical Debt**: Maintain clean architecture from the start

### Development Philosophy
- **User-Centric Design**: Every feature decision should improve the core writing experience
- **Performance as a Feature**: Speed and responsiveness are key differentiators
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works, AI suggestions enhance it
- **Accessibility by Default**: Build inclusive experiences from the ground up

## Current Challenges & Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- **AI Latency Management**: Balancing suggestion quality with response speed
- **Cost Optimization**: Managing OpenAI API costs while maintaining quality
- **Real-time Performance**: Ensuring smooth experience with live suggestions
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Consistent experience across target browsers

### UX Challenges
- **Suggestion Overwhelm**: Presenting feedback without disrupting writing flow
- **Learning Curve**: Making AI suggestions discoverable and actionable
- **Export Complexity**: Seamless formatting for different output formats
- **Mobile Experience**: Adapting three-pane layout for smaller screens

### Business Considerations
- **User Onboarding**: Minimizing friction while capturing necessary information
- **Value Demonstration**: Quickly showing the benefit of AI suggestions
- **Retention Strategy**: Building habits around the optimization workflow
- **Scalability Planning**: Preparing for growth beyond 100 concurrent users
